# TicketToRideProject
A C++ project written from scratch attempting to simulate the game Ticket To Ride

## Overview

This is a project that is attempting to allow artificial intelligence to play the popular board game Ticket To Ride. 
The AI is given to us in the form of a JSON file, which the program then reads in, simulates a game, and produces the results of said game.
The application and executable are currently in an unfinished state and this project as of December 2021 is on an indefinite hiatus.

The game engine infrastructure and inputs and displays were all written from scratch, and over the course of this project I learned how to better organize my code, as well as taking user's feedback into account when testing, as well as heavy debugging and overhauling of broken classes and errors. It utilizes the graphics program SDL2 and the json library json-c.
